# D Basics Project
This project stems from the desire to improve the D ecosystem. It is an unfortunate truth that D's ecosystem is lacking. The DLF already has a list of projects that are really important to the core D project, this is not the point of this list. This list is for the other tooling which are missing and which independent D projects really need to succeed.

Any contribution to the list is welcome.
